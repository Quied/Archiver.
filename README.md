# Archiver.
My first project implemented on QT, because code a little doesn't look good
Not implemented:                                                                
"Path save" -> create folder on desktop, and all compressed files put into it  
"Password" -> add password into compressed files                                 
"Time compress" -> Set time, when will be need to compressing file          
"History" -> Maybe need create .txt file into folder of project, and make notes as what was: File path - date - file format - size - size on out - password
